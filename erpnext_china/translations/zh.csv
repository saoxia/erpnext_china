"## Products and Services

Depending on the nature of your business, you might be selling products or services to your clients or even both. 
ERPNext is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase.

The **Item Master**  is where you can add all your sales items. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. If you run a manufacturing business, the same master is used for keeping a record of raw materials, sub-assemblies etc.

Completing the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of ERPNext. We have a brief video introducing the item master for you, you can watch it in the next step.","## 产品与服务
